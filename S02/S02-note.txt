VPC: Virtual Private Cloud

VPV is a virtual data center in the cloud. 1- client has full control over it.
				          				   2 - can have one or more subnets.
					   					   3- a VPC is confined to a singe AWS regions.





each VPC is isolated from other VPC in single region.


each VPC has these components:

1 - CIDR block and subnets.
2 - implied router.
3 - Route Tables.
4 - IGW (Internet Gateway)
5 - VGW (Virtual Private Gateway)
6 - Security Groups
7 - Network ACLs


note: when you create a VPC you can  not change main cird you assigned to it.
each AZ can has multiple subnet.

implied router: 
 - used to communicate among the subnets in VPCs, its managed by AWS and you cannot change it. and route table can has multiple subnets.

IGW(Internet GateWay)

IGW : managed by AWS,suppot ipv4 and ipv6 and its highly available.

IGW should attach to specific VPC
eash vpc can has only 1 IGW and each IGW can attach only to one VPC

if you want create a VPC and grant internet access you should create a IGW and attached it to the VPC. without that the VPC is private.


VGW : if you have hybrid cloud (on-premise cloud and public cloud) for connectivity between these 2,use VGW or (and direct connect)

- VGW look like VPN. (its very depends on internet speed.)

for class scenario :

1 - create a VPC
2 - create 2 subnets
3 - create a IGW fora and attach to VPC
4 - create a Route Table in VPC
5 - association subnets to a routing table (default table and the table you created it.)
6 - add "0.0.0.0/0" route to public routing table
7 - add EC2 instance on the vpc and specific subnet you want
