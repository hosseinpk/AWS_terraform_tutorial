VPC: Virtual Private Cloud

VPV is a virtual data center in the cloud. 1- client has full control over it.
				          				   2 - can have one or more subnets.
					   					   3- a VPC is confined to a singe AWS regions.





each VPC is isolated from other VPC in single region.


each VPC has these components:

1 - CIDR block and subnets.
2 - implied router.
3 - Route Tables.
4 - IGW (Internet Gateway)
5 - VGW (Virtual Private Gateway)
6 - Security Groups
7 - Network ACLs


note: when you create a VPC you can  not change main CIDR you assigned to it.
each AZ can has multiple subnet.

implied router: 
 - used to communicate among the subnets in VPCs, its managed by AWS and you cannot change it. and route table can has multiple subnets.

IGW(Internet GateWay)

IGW : managed by AWS,support ipv4 and ipv6 and its highly available.

IGW should attach to specific VPC
each vpc can has only 1 IGW and each IGW can attach only to one VPC

if you want create a VPC and grant internet access you should create a IGW and attached it to the VPC. without that the VPC is private.


VGW : if you have hybrid cloud (on-premise cloud and public cloud) for connectivity between these 2,use VGW or (and direct connect)

- VGW look like VPN. (its very depends on internet speed.)

for class scenario :

1 - create a VPC
2 - create 2 subnets
3 - create a IGW fora and attach to VPC
4 - create a Route Table in VPC
5 - association subnets to a routing table (default table and the table you created it.)
6 - add "0.0.0.0/0" route to public routing table
7 - add EC2 instance on the vpc and specific subnet you want






=======================================================================================

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- resizable
- ec2 instance can be provisioned on shared or dedicated host(resource)
- instances are isolated from each other.
- each instance is launched in a subnet in an AZ

EBS (Elastic Block Store)

- is a storage service.
- can attach more than one volume to instance.
- root volume (the volume that installed os on it.)
- EC2 instances with an EBS root volume are called EB-backed-EC2 instances.(os should install on EBS)

instance-store : temporary storage, high speed , faster than EBS


connect to linux server : ssh
connect to windows server : RDP

you need a key pair to login (the private key you have and public key stored in AWS).
download private key from console, grant permission (400),connect over ssh:

ssh -i "<private_key>" <user@host>

note : for keep ebs instance and data on it ==> delete on termination = no


Private,public and Elastic IP Addresses


Elastic IP Addresses : routable in internet, its a public ip address but when instances stopped in public ip address,
ip will change after start again, Elastic IP Addresses is permanent(should assign manually),and after stop and restart, remain on instance.
and should release manually. if you use it, not chargeable. if don't use you should charge it.

for set in console:

EC2 - Elastic IP Addresses - allocate Elastic ip address --> associate ip address to an instance

for remove it --> diassociate Elastic ip address and release ip address
